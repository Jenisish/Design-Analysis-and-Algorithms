# Design-Analysis-and-Algorithms

studentdetails.cpp ==Create a Java class called Student with the following details as variables within it. 
(i) USN
(ii) Name
(iii) Programme
(iv) Phone
Write a CPP program to create nStudent objects and print the USN, Name, Programme, and Phoneof these objects with suitable headings.



stackoperation.cpp == Write a CPP program to implement the Stack using arrays. Write Push(), Pop(), and Display() methods to demonstrate its working.



superclass.cpp == Design a superclass called Staff with details as StaffId, Name, Phone, Salary. Extend this class by writing three subclasses namely Teaching (domain, publications), Technical (skills), and Contract (period). Write a CPP program to read and display at least 3 staff objects of all three categories.



dob.cpp == Write a CPP class called Customer to store their name and date_of_birth. The date_of_birth format should be dd/mm/yyyy. Write methods to read customer data as and display as using StringTokenizer class considering the delimiter character as “/”.



exception.cpp == Write a CPP program to read two integers a andb. Compute a/b and print, when b is not zero. Raise an exception when b is equal to zero.



multithreading.cpp == Write a CPP program that implements a multi-thread application that has three threads. First thread generates a random integer for every 1 second; second thread computes the square of the number and prints; third thread will print the value of cube of the number.




quicksort.cpp == Sort a given set of n integer elements using Quick Sort method and compute its time complexity. Run the program for varied values of n> 5000 and record the time taken to sort. Plot a graph of the time taken versus non graph sheet. The elements can be read from a file or can be generated using the random number generator. Demonstrate using CPP how the divide-and-conquer method works along with its time complexity analysis: worst case, average case and best case.




mergesort.cpp == Sort a given set of n integer elements using Merge Sort method and compute its time complexity. Run the program for varied values of n> 5000, and record the time taken to sort. Plot a graph of the time taken versus non graph sheet. The elements can be read from a file or can be generated using the random number generator. Demonstrate using CPP how the divide-and-conquer method works along with its time complexity analysis: worst case, average case and best case.



knapsack.cpp == Implement in CPP, the 0/1 Knapsack problem using (a) Dynamic Programming method 
greedy.cpp   == (b) Greedy method.




dijkstra.cpp == From a given vertex in a weighted connected graph, find shortest paths to other vertices using Dijkstra's algorithm. Write the program in CPP.




krushkal.cpp == Find Minimum Cost Spanning Tree of a given connected undirected graph using Kruskal'salgorithm. Use Union-Find algorithms in your program




prims.cpp == Find Minimum Cost Spanning Tree of a given connected undirected graph using Prim's algorithm.



floyd.cpp == Write CPP programs to (a) Implement All-Pairs Shortest Paths problem using Floyd's algorithm.
dynamic.cpp == (b) Implement Travelling Sales Person problem using Dynamic programming.




Subset.cpp  ==   Design and implement in CPP to find a subset of a given set S = {Sl, S2,.....,Sn} of n positive integers whose SUM is equal to a given positive integer d. For example, if S ={1, 2, 5, 6, 8} and d= 9, there are two solutions {1,2,6}and {1,8}. Display a suitable message, if the given problem instance doesn't have a solution.



hamiltion.cpp  ==  Design and implement in CPP to find all Hamiltonian Cycles in a connected undirected Graph G of n vertices using backtracking principle.
